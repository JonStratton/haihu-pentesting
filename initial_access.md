**SSH**

By default, SSHd is open on the default install of Haiku. While the default “user” user has no password, SSHd’s initial configuration is to only allow key based auth, not to allow “root” login (which in this case applies to “user”), and to not permit empty passwords. It would be unlikely that a user was technically proficient enough to change these settings while still not setting an account password. 

However, if the SSHd config is changed and a user password is set, the default username is “user”. So an ssh password guessing attack would probably be easy enough:

    hydra -f -l user -P ./passwords.lst shredder.lan ssh
    ...
    [22][ssh] host: shredder.lan   login: user   password: Password1!

**Telnet and FTP**

A more likely scenario might be someone enabling FTP (or even possibly Telnet) in the network settings. If these are enabled before an initial password is set, full system access can be had by simply logging on one of these systems with the “user” user with an empty password.
