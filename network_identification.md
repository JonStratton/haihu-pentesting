**Network Identification and Enumeration**<br />
Plan 9 is a Grid Operating System. As with many things, what it looks like depends on its use. Below is what these servers might look like when doing an nmap with service/version detection.

**Default/Built-in SSH Server**<br />

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.8 (protocol 2.0)
    
Note, if you see an open File Server, you might be able to read (and write to) the filesystem with the "user" user.

**Built-in FTP Server**<br />

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    21/tcp open  ftp     WU-FTPD or MIT Kerberos ftpd 6.00LS

**Built-in Telnet Server**<br />

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    23/tcp open  telnet  Openwall GNU/*/Linux telnetd

**PoorMan Web Server**<br />

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    80/tcp open  rtsp

Note, HTTP Server responds with "Server: Haiku/PoorMan" in header. Error pages are also labeled "Haiku/PoorMan".

**BeShare Server**<br />

    PORT     STATE SERVICE          VERSION
    7000/tcp open  afs3-fileserver?
